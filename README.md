# PyBer Analysis

## Overview of Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to provide a summary of how the data differs depending on if the ride is urban, suburban or rural, and the total weekly fares for each city type.

## Results

Key findings of PyBer summary:
  - While Rural cities have the least amount of drivers and rides, the average fare per ride and driver is higher than both Suburban and Urban
  - Suburban cities have 6 times more drivers than rural cities and 4.5 times more revenue
  - Urban cities have 5 times more drivers than suburban cities and 2 times more revenue
  - Even though the average fare per driver is less, the overall total revenue is greater when there are more drivers

Key findings of Total Fare by City Type by week:
  - All city types either had a drastic dip or were flat in April week one
    - We would want to look to see if this is a trend year over year or a one off
    - Was there a weather event that prevented people from wanting to travel?
  - The majority of the time, when there is a peak, there is a peak for each city type during the same week

## Summary

My recommendation would be to increase the number of drivers in rural cities.  An assumption can be made that the reason that the fare is higher in rural cities is that the length of the ride is longer.  This limits the number of rides an individual driver can provide on a given day.  
As there are less rides in rural cities, look at destinations for those rides.  If the ride goes to a suburban or urban city, could the driver accept some rides in the destination city before heading back to the rural city?  This would give that driver more rides and there would be less wasted time with an empty vehicle all the way back home.
Gather more data to see if you can determine why totals fares dropped at the end of March.  Once that is determined, an action plan can be put in place to increase ridership next year over the same time period.
